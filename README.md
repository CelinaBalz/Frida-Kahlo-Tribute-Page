## Bem vindo!

Esse repositorio faz parte de uma serie de 10 desafios Html e CSS para iniciantes do site (Codecademy)[https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/html-and-css-code-challenges-for-beginners/] ! 

Nesse projeto estarei fazendo o design e front-end do inicio seguindo os temas indicados no desafio.

## Primeiro desafio

Choose a historical figure who's meaningful to you and create a webpage dedicated to them. The webpage should include:

A title or heading with the person's name
An image of the person
A caption for the image
A timeline of the person's life in the form of a list
This can be completed with only HTML, but use CSS to give it some style.
